# Namespaces

## Definition

* Namespaces are a method of grouping related PHP code elements within a library or application

## Use

* Helps to prevent accidentally re-defining functions, classes, constants, etc

* Avoids having to use long, highly descriptive class names

* Constants, classes and functions are affected by the use of namespaces

* Create sub-namespaces to sub-divide a library

## Declaring namespaces

* Must declare the use of namespaces with keyword 'namespace' at the beginning of the code file (right after <?PHP)
