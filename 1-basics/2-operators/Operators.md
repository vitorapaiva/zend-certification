# Operators

## Arithmetic operators

	* Basic calculations
		** + (adding)
		** - (substracting)
		** * (multiplying)
		** / (dividing)
	* Modulus (remainder when dividing)
		** Ex: $m = 5%2; // $m == 1

## Bitwise operators (review)
	
	* Use to work with bits withing an integer; arithmetic
	* Integral Numbers are internally converted into bits
		**Ex: 5 -> 0101 = 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1
	* Shift bits << X move bits by X times
		** Ex: 4 >> 2 == 1 (like dividing by 4)
	* Negate bits ~ convert 0s into 1s ; 1s into 0s

## Logical Operators:
	* & equivalent to 'AND': matching "1" in both operands
	* | equivalent to OR: at least one "1" in an operand
	* ^ equivalent to EITHER-OR: only one "1" in both operands
