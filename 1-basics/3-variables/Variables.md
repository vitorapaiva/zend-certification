# Variables

## Naming
* Start with a "$"
* Contains letters, numbers, and underscores
* By convention, start with lower case
* Case-sensitive

## Referencing
* Variables can be assigned by value or by reference
* Attach an "&" to the beginning of the variable being assigned

## Initializing
* Variables have their type set by default, if not initialized (which is optional)
* Not initializing variables can potentialy lead to repetitive variable names (and collisions) when working with multiple files
* isset() is used to determine whether a variable has been initialized
