# Perfomance

## Factors affecting perfomance (two major areas)
	* Reduced memory usage
	* Run-time delays

## Garbage Collection

	* Clears circular-reference variables (REVISAR) once prerequisites are met, via root-buffer full or call to the function GC_COLLECT_CYCLES()
	* Garbage Collection Execution hinders perfomance (REVISAR)

## OPCODE CACHE

	* Stores the bytecode/opcode (REVISAR) results of compiling PHP code which often improves perfomance
	* Available into PHP 5.5 (needs to be turned on). third-party products are also available (REVISAR)
